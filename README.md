Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use **Chill.me** locally.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to manage API keys and Firebase configurations:

- **100ms Config**: `APP_SECRET`, `APP_ACCESS_KEY`
- **Firebase Config**: `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- **Stripe Config**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (required only for credit purchases)

Refer to the `.env.example` file for all required variables.

## Getting Started

To create a video room:

1. Enter your name in the "Your name" field.
2. Enter a room name if you're a broadcaster.
3. Click **Join** to create or enter a room.
4. Share the generated room URL to invite guests directly.

Guests can join by clicking the shared link and entering their details.

## Server Actions

Chill.me uses **Next.js 14 server actions** to handle payments and live streaming features. Unlike traditional API routes, server actions in Next.js 14 allow you to run server-side code directly within your components without the need for creating separate API routes. This approach simplifies the codebase and improves performance by removing the need for client-server network requests in many cases.

### Benefits of Next.js 14 Server Actions

- **Simplified Code**: Server actions are used within components, eliminating the need for a separate API route in many cases.
- **Performance**: By running the server code directly in the component, you avoid unnecessary round-trip requests between the client and server.
- **Security**: Server actions provide better security since sensitive logic remains on the server and never reaches the client.

### Payment Actions

Managed through **Stripe**, the server actions related to payments include:

- **createPaymentIntent**: Initializes a payment intent for credit purchases.
- **validatePaymentIntent**: Confirms the payment status by validating the payment intent.

### Live Stream Actions

Powered by **100ms**, the following actions manage room creation and authentication:

- **createRoom**: Creates a live stream room.
- **getAppToken**: Generates an authentication token for users to join the room.

Server action logic is contained within:

- `app/serverActions/paymentActions.ts`
- `app/serverActions/100msLiveActions.ts`

## Profile Management

Users can manage their profiles, including API keys and credits, through the profile page:

- **Profile Store**: Stores user information such as API keys, display name, credits, and profile photo.
- **API Key Management**: Users can enter their own API keys (100ms, Fireworks, OpenAI, Stability) or use platform credits.
- **Credit System**: Users can purchase credits via Stripe if they don't have their own API keys.

The profile information is stored and synced with **Firebase**, ensuring real-time updates.
